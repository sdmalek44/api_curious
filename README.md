# Api Curious
  
In this project we were to consume part of the github API that contained our personal user information and display it on our own site. The purpose of this project was to learn how to use omniauth and how to consume public APIs using plain ruby objects to model JSON data recieved from API calls.  

## Requirements

Build a basic version of the Github profile / feed UI. As a user, I should be able to:

* Authenticate with my github account
* View basic information about my account (profile pic, number of starred repos, followers, following)
* View a summary feed of my recent activity (recent commits)
* View a summary feed of recent activity from users whom I follow
* View a list of organizations Iâ€™m a member of
* View a list of my repositories  

## Setup  
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sdmalek44/api_curious.git  
$ bundle install 
$ rails s
(in browser navigate to localhost:3000)  
```
